#### Authentication: 
- Removed Gmail authentication: requested from testers who want to connect anonymously to the app
- Added email registration without email verification


#### Fix(es):
- The "#" symbol, sometimes remained in the sidebar after delation of a channel. For now you cannot delete a channel. A delete button will be included in the next patch. (I also want to add up content for testing purposes, not remove it)
- The search bar was not working on iOS devices and had an algorithm issue. It has been removed.
- The send button was not working on iOS devices. It works now on any device and any format.

#### Design:
- Text formating & color: The text was visible on small devices even though one would be a good distance away. Although, format remained barely readable. 
- Removed unecessary options: those either not working, undergoing work or for decorative purpose.

#### Naming:
Likor-Sblack is now Likor***. 
Likor-S"color" (where color=random color) served me to identify prototypes I was designing for DiFFrenZZ web-chat-app. 

*** *Likor is the contraction of 2 latin words*
- Loquor-*speak[neg.]* (Nec Gallice nec Theodisce loquor) 
- Liquo (as, are, avi, atum) - *to clarify* - common meaning during the 1st century BC was (HORATIUS/HORACE)
