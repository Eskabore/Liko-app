# Likor

## Description

Likor is a chat web application developed by the DiFFrenZZ Project. It utilizes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralized, real-time communication. Likor provides the following features to its users:

-   Complete anonymity: Encryption is based on the Double Ratchet Algorithm, extended to support encryption for rooms containing thousands of devices.
-   Fully decentralized conversations with no single points of control or failure: When a user sends a message in Likor, it is replicated over all the servers whose users are participating in a given conversation. Even if a user's server goes offline, the conversation can continue uninterrupted elsewhere until it returns. This is how Likor democratizes control over communication.
-   Data and message exchange with other platforms using an open standard: Supports dynamically bridging IRC channels on demand and synchronized user-lists through maintained bridges to Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Hangouts, Gitter, iMessage, and more.

Services and channels available exclusively to users located in Berlin include:

-   Lost & Found channel: People who lost an object or an animal with proof of ownership (ID, passport, phone, dog, etc.) have a greater chance of finding it back by posting an ad and searching through the channel's conversation history (limited to 10 days prior). Anyone can propose a reward or request compensation for any exchange or trade of goods and services. Nevertheless, DiFFrenZZ intends to promote free mutual aid and information sharing through the Likor web app.
-   Dead-dropping: The dead drop method allows the vendor to drop the product at a secret and random geographical location that only the two parties are aware of. This idea skips global mail systems, and customers can remain anonymous and donâ€™t have to reveal an address.
-   Escrow Accounts: Escrow is a process used when two parties are in the process of completing a transaction, and there is uncertainty over whether one party or another will be able to fulfill their obligations. Contexts that use escrow include internet transactions, banking, intellectual property, real estate, mergers and acquisitions, and law, among many others.

Note that users located outside of Berlin will have restricted access to certain functionalities. These restrictions are implemented to build trust between parties, sellers, vendors, and DiFFrenZZ administrators. It allows for an exchange of goods and services based on a promise.
